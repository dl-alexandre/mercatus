## Purpose
Develop a real-time machine learning system for detecting market patterns and predicting short-term price movements in cryptocurrencies available on Robinhood. The system will process live market data from Robinhood's API to identify profitable trading opportunities while adapting to changing market conditions through continuous learning.

## Key Objectives
- Achieve directional accuracy >60% on 1-5 minute predictions for Robinhood-supported cryptocurrencies
- Process data with <100ms latency from Robinhood API
- Maintain model performance through automated retraining with Robinhood market data
- Integrate seamlessly with Robinhood's trading execution system
- Support automated DCA (Dollar-Cost Averaging) strategies on Robinhood

## Ethical Considerations and Compliance
- **Bias Detection**: Implement checks for training data bias to avoid overfitting to specific market conditions
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Adhere to SEC regulations, Robinhood's API terms of service, and anti-money laundering regulations for algorithmic trading on retail platforms
- **Human Oversight**: Require manual approval for trades exceeding $10k based on AI predictions
- **Fairness Audits**: Conduct regular audits to ensure equitable coin selection across market caps and regions
- **Robinhood-Specific**: Respect Robinhood's rate limits (100 requests/minute) and trading restrictions on certain cryptocurrencies

## Key Components

### 1. Data Ingestion
- **Robinhood API Integration**: Collect OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) and account data from Robinhood's REST API
- **Authentication**: Implement Ed25519 signature-based authentication using API key and private key pairs
- **Rate Limiting**: Enforce 100 requests/minute limit with token bucket algorithm to stay within Robinhood's API constraints
- **Data Normalization**: Standardize Robinhood data formats and apply consistent timestamping
- **Quality Control**: Implement real-time data validation, filtering of invalid quotes, and handling of Robinhood-specific quirks
- **Security and Privacy Measures**: Encrypt data in transit (TLS 1.3), store credentials securely in environment variables, implement role-based access controls, and follow Robinhood's data retention policies

### 2. Feature Extraction
- **Technical Indicators**: Compute standard indicators (RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, volatility measures, momentum oscillators) from Robinhood price data
- **Robinhood-Specific Features**: Calculate holding-to-market-ratio, buying power utilization, and account-specific features
- **Statistical Features**: Apply rolling-window statistics (moving averages, standard deviations, percentiles) over multiple timeframes
- **Advanced Features**: Include volume-weighted features and microstructural indicators from Robinhood's order flow
- **DCA Integration Features**: Track deposit patterns, allocation percentages, and investment schedule adherence

### 3. Pattern Recognition
- **Unsupervised Clustering**: Use k-means and DBSCAN algorithms to identify distinct market regimes and volatility states
- **Sequence Modeling**: Employ LSTM, Transformer, and Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN) for detecting complex time-series patterns
- **Anomaly Detection**: Implement statistical and ML-based methods (Isolation Forest, Autoencoders) to flag irregular price behavior and market events
- **Pattern Classification**: Categorize detected patterns into actionable trading signals (breakouts, reversals, consolidations)
- **Robinhood Market Regime Detection**: Identify Robinhood-specific patterns like high retail activity periods and platform-specific volatility

### 4. Predictive Modeling
- **Model Types**: Train regression models for price magnitude prediction and classification models for directional movement using Robinhood historical data
- **Ensemble Methods**: Combine multiple models using averaging and stacking techniques for improved stability and accuracy
- **Online Learning**: Implement continuous model adaptation using techniques like online gradient descent and concept drift detection based on Robinhood market data
- **Regime Adaptation**: Dynamically adjust model weights based on detected market regimes and volatility conditions
- **Model Governance and Explainability**: Use SHAP values for feature importance, implement model versioning and audit trails, conduct A/B testing for updates, and document model decisions for transparency
- **SmartVestor Integration**: Support intelligent allocation decisions based on Robinhood account balance and DCA strategy preferences

### 5. Evaluation & Deployment
- **Performance Metrics**: Track RMSE for regression, directional accuracy for classification, Sharpe ratio for risk-adjusted returns
- **Backtesting Framework**: Implement walk-forward validation using Robinhood historical data, cross-validation on multiple market regimes (bull, bear, sideways), stress testing for black swan events, paper trading integration, and overfitting checks
- **Inference Optimization**: Deploy as microservice optimized with MLX (Apple Silicon) or Core ML for low-latency inference
- **Trading Integration**: Provide weighted decision inputs to SmartVestor's allocation engine with confidence scores and risk assessments
- **Monitoring & Alerting**: Implement comprehensive monitoring of model performance, data quality, and system health
- **Robinhood API Health**: Monitor rate limit usage, authentication status, and API response times
